This is a short exercise for revising html. It's been a while and sure I have 
a computer science degree and had to do html alot so this is somewhat annoying
But I need this project built and if I have forgotten concepts, I certainly 
should revise. It's going to take time but if I stick to it, by May next year,
by God's grace, I am certainly going to be at a more impressive level.
